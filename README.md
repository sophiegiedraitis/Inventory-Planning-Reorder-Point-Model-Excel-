- High Demand: High inventory demand leads to a higher economic order quantity and reorder point and a lower safety stock amount
- Long Lead Time: Long lead times lead to a higher amount of needed safety stock and reorder point
- High Service Level: High service level leads to a higher amount of needed safety stock and a higher reorder point amount
